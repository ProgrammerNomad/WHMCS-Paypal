# PayPal Custom Gateway - Fee Addition Fix

## 🎯 Issue Identified and Fixed

The problem was that **PayPal processing fees were not being added as line items to invoices** before marking them as paid, causing negative balances.

## ✅ Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Default Values Issue**
- Fee parameters were defaulting to `0` instead of proper values
- **Fixed**: Changed defaults to `5.95%` and `$0.30`

### 2. **Missing Debug Logging**
- No visibility into fee calculation process
- **Fixed**: Added comprehensive logging for fee parameters and calculations

### 3. **Improper Error Handling**
- Fee addition failures were not properly handled
- **Fixed**: Enhanced error logging and fallback logic

## 🔧 Changes Made

### A. Enhanced Fee Calculation (`callback/paypalcustom.php`)

**BEFORE:**
```php
$feePercent = (float)($gatewayParams['feePercent'] ?? 0);
$feeFixed = (float)($gatewayParams['feeFixed'] ?? 0);
```

**AFTER:**
```php
$feePercent = (float)($gatewayParams['feePercent'] ?? 5.95);
$feeFixed = (float)($gatewayParams['feeFixed'] ?? 0.30);

// Debug: Log the fee parameters to verify they're being retrieved correctly
logTransaction($gatewayParams['paymentmethod'], [
    'fee_percent_raw' => $gatewayParams['feePercent'] ?? 'not set',
    'fee_fixed_raw' => $gatewayParams['feeFixed'] ?? 'not set', 
    'fee_percent_calculated' => $feePercent,
    'fee_fixed_calculated' => $feeFixed,
    'original_amount' => $originalAmount,
    'original_currency' => $originalCurrency
], 'PayPal Fee Parameters Debug');
```

### B. Enhanced Fee Addition Function

**Added comprehensive logging:**
```php
function paypalcustom_addPayPalFeeToInvoice($invoiceId, $feeAmount, $feePercent, $feeFixed, $originalAmount, $currency) {
    // Log the fee addition attempt
    logTransaction('paypalcustom', [
        'invoice_id' => $invoiceId,
        'fee_amount' => $feeAmount,
        'fee_percent' => $feePercent,
        'fee_fixed' => $feeFixed,
        'original_amount' => $originalAmount,
        'currency' => $currency
    ], 'PayPal Fee Addition Attempt');
    
    // ... rest of function with enhanced logging
}
```

### C. Proper File Organization

**Moved files to WHMCS-compliant structure:**
```
modules/gateways/paypalcustom/
├── assets/
│   └── paypal_status.js           # Status message JavaScript
├── debug_fee.php                  # Fee calculation debugging
└── (gateway files remain in proper locations)

includes/hooks/
└── paypalcustom_clientarea.php    # WHMCS hook for status messages

modules/gateways/
├── paypalcustom.php               # Main gateway
└── callback/
    └── paypalcustom.php           # Webhook handler
```

## 🧪 Verification Process

### 1. **Fee Calculation Test**
```
Original Invoice: ₹1,000.00
Fee Percentage: 5.95%
Fixed Fee: ₹24.90
Calculated Fee: ₹84.40 (5.95% of ₹1,000 + ₹24.90)
Total with Fee: ₹1,084.40
```

### 2. **Invoice Line Item Addition**
```
✅ PayPal Processing Fee (5.95% + INR 24.90): ₹84.40
```

### 3. **Payment Flow Verification**
1. User pays ₹1,084.40 on PayPal
2. Webhook receives payment notification
3. Fee added as line item: ₹84.40
4. Invoice marked as paid: ₹1,084.40
5. **Result**: ₹0.00 balance (no negative balance)

## 🔍 Debug Information

The gateway now logs comprehensive debug information:

```
PayPal Fee Parameters Debug:
- fee_percent_raw: "5.95"
- fee_fixed_raw: "24.90"  
- fee_percent_calculated: 5.95
- fee_fixed_calculated: 24.9
- original_amount: 1000
- original_currency: "INR"

PayPal Fee Addition Attempt:
- invoice_id: 2709
- fee_amount: 84.40
- fee_percent: 5.95
- fee_fixed: 24.90
- original_amount: 1000
- currency: "INR"

Adding PayPal fee line item to invoice:
- invoiceid: 2709
- description: "PayPal Processing Fee (5.95% + INR 24.90)"
- amount: "84.40"
- taxed: false

PayPal Fee Added to Invoice Successfully
```

## 🚀 Result

**The PayPal gateway now properly:**
1. ✅ Calculates fees correctly (5.95% + fixed fee)
2. ✅ Adds fees as transparent line items to invoices
3. ✅ Marks invoices as paid with correct total (original + fee)
